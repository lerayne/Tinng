UltiComm (Ultimate Communications) also shortened to UC (pronounced as You-See) is an ambitious
project of an online communications engine with a goal to kick out the obsolete forums technologies
which still tend to reload the page every now-and-then and act like a page in the interface meaning.

As an opposite to forums, UC will be a real web-app that doing the same task (discussions on
specific topics) and perhaps a little more.
